## <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>

Hi! My name is @StevenCopeland. I have a lot of projects on Github, so in this project I am going to link all of the projects together and post all my new projects here. This is sort of going to be a "blog" where I "post" new projects. If you would like to subscribe, then either follow me @StevenCopeland, follow this project, or subscribe to the RSS feed on the website.
