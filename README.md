## <a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction

Hi! My name is @StevenCopeland. I have a lot of projects on Github, so in this project I am going to link all of the projects together and post all my new projects here. This is sort of going to be a "blog" where I "post" new projects. If you would like to subscribe, then either follow me @StevenCopeland, follow this project, or subscribe to the RSS feed on the website.

## <a name="TODO"></a>TODO/Plans

TODO/Plans/Ideas section is going to be on what I am planning to do.

### <a name="projects"></a>Projects To Add

#### Here is a list of the projects I want to add

[Stores](https://stevencopeland.github.io/Stores/)

Stores is a game I created with the help of @Goredbirds. It was the first game I have ever created and probably on of the best.

[FILEPLAN](https://stevencopeland.github.io/FILEPLAN/)

FILEPLAN is one of the best games I have ever made even though it is still in progress, it is really fun to play.
